Hello reader! Thank you for your interest in my portfolio :) My story began at Michigan State University as a chemical engineer, and I took my first coding class as a college requirement. I started with MATLAB, and in a few weeks, I was hooked (yes, you read that correctly). I changed my major, graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science, and I have never looked back. I credit this to my belief that technology can benefit billions of lives.

Since my transition, I’ve explored embedded systems, back-end, and front-end development. My passion is reserved for mobile app development, particularly iOS. I’ve released two monetized apps on the App Store, and I plan to continue both learning and pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities in the information technology industry! Additionally, I am currently learning React Native, and Flutter!
